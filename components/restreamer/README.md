Ephyr re-streamer
=================

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Simple web application allowing to forward [RTMP] streams in a similar way as [facecast.io] does. It uses [SRS] to accept [RTMP] streams and [FFmpeg] to forward them.

## Deployment
ðŸš€ Deploy to [DigitalOcean][101] ([ru][102]), [Hetzner Cloud][111] ([ru][112]), [Oracle Cloud][121] ([ru][122]), [VScale\Selectel (ru)][123].

### Deploy script options
This script automates the setup and configuration of Ephyr-restreamer on a Linux system.
It installs Docker, sets up the firewall, and creates the required directories and configuration files.
The script also installs the Ephyr-restreamer executor and a SystemD service to manage the Ephyr-restreamer Docker container.

You can customize the script behavior by setting the following environment variables before running the script:

1. `EPHYR_VER`: Set the Ephyr-restreamer version. Default is '0.6.0'. Set to 'latest' for the latest version.
2. `REGISTRY_URL`: Set the Docker registry URL. Default is 'docker.io'.
3. `REGISTRY_USER`: Set the Docker registry username if using a custom registry.
4. `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: Set the Docker registry password if using a custom registry.
5. `EPHYR_CLI_ARGS`: Set any additional CLI arguments for the Ephyr-restreamer Docker container.
6. `WITH_INITIAL_UPGRADE`: Set to '1' if the system requires a full update before installing (e.g., for Selectel). Default is '0'.
7. `WITH_FIREWALLD`: Set to '1' if the system requires firewalld instead of ufw (e.g., for Oracle). Default is '0'.
8. `EPHYR_RESTREAMER_JAEGER_AGENT_IP`: Set the IP address of the Jaeger agent if you want to send traces to Jaeger.
9. `EPHYR_RESTREAMER_JAEGER_AGENT_PORT`: Set the port of the Jaeger agent if you want to send traces to Jaeger.
10. `EPHYR_RESTREAMER_JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME`: Set the Jaeger service name for the Ephyr-restreamer traces. Default is the hostname of the machine.
11. `CLEAR_STATE_ON_RESTART`: Clear `state.json` each restart of Ephyr-restreamer. Default is '0'.
12. `ALLOWED_IPS`: Set allowed IP addresses to access server. Default is '*'.

Example usage:
  `EPHYR_VER=latest WITH_INITIAL_UPGRADE=1 ./ubuntu-20-04-x64.sh`
